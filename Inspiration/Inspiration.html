                    Tyla Vaeau is a Samoan tattoo artist in New Zealand, blending Western knowledge with traditional practices. 
                    She holds a BFA from Elam, an MA in Art History, and apprenticed with Su’a Sulu’ape Alaiva’a Petelo. 
                    Specializing in the malu, her work symbolizes protection, identity, and lineage. 
                    Tyla’s style and cultural expertise inspire my own artistic journey.

                    Parris Gobel is a trailblazing dancer, choreographer, and Polynesian pioneer from New Zealand. 
                    Fierce and incredibly talented, Parris has made a significant impact in a space where Polynesian representation is often limited. 
                    She inspires me to passionately pursue my love for art and shows me that there is a place for Polynesian women like myself. 
                    As both a woman and an artist, Parris’s journey motivates me to continue striving for greatness in my own creative path.

                    Emesa Amze is a London-based artist whose work celebrates beauty, strength, and resilience, particularly through powerful depictions of women exuding confidence and pride. 
                    Her use of vibrant, saturated colors and dynamic painting techniques has inspired me to work more efficiently in my own pieces, and I aspire to eventually explore spray painting to create large-scale murals
