                <p> Hope is a Junior Visual Communications major at San Francisco State University. She initially began her academic journey at Sonoma State University, pursuing a Bachelor’s in Biochemistry, but her path shifted due to the 2020 global pandemic. 
                    During this time, Hope took some time off from school, deciding to fully embrace her passion for the creative industry. 
                    While preparing to transfer, she earned a certificate in Visual Media Design Foundations at City College of San Francisco before ultimately transferring to SFSU in 2024.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> A 24-year-old artist from the Bay Area, Hope is a first-generation college student. 
                As the daughter of immigrants who made great sacrifices to provide her with better opportunities, her family's experiences have deeply influenced the way she navigates life. 
                Reflecting on their sacrifices is a constant source of motivation in her pursuit of higher education. 
                Coming from a lineage of talented creatives and musicians who, unfortunately, never had the chance to fully pursue their artistic dreams, Hope channels their aspirations into her own journey. 
                From a young age, Hope has always expressed herself through art. As a self-taught artist, she has evolved from drawing on school desks to developing a distinct visual voice. 
                Her work is deeply inspired by her Samoan heritage, incorporating cultural motifs, patterns, and personal experiences. Upon graduation, Hope aspires to build a career in Art or Creative Direction, collaborating with like-minded creatives to bring innovative ideas to life
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> In her free time, Hope enjoys drawing on her iPad, spending time with her sisters, and listening to music. 
                She finds peace in nature walks, enjoys lavender lattes, and loves spending nights out with friends, especially when they’re dancing to house music all night. 
                With a Taurus Sun, Capricorn Moon, and Scorpio Rising, Hope approaches her personal and professional life with determination, creativity, and passion.
